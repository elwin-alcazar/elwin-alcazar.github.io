      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <hr></hr>
      <h2>A story when I got blocked on a simple problem</h2>
        <p>I was trying to solve this coding challenge that involves using a simple loop. I tried to run my code, but it stops due to an error. I am a bit confused as to why it isn’t running since I am confident that my code is correct. I've been writing loops all my life! I tried to run it again and again – the same error keeps appearing. </p> 
        <p>Then I thought to myself, hey, why don’t you try to read what the error is saying.  I read the error log and that’s when I realized that it’s just a syntax error, meaning that I used comma instead of semi-colon in my code. Correcting this issue made by code run perfectly. </p>
        <p class = "margin-add">I felt silly that the reason I was having problems is because of a careless mistake. I now have an appreciation for error logs and I know that they can help me solve my problem.</p>
        <hr></hr>
      
      <h2>A story where I solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
        <p>I was doing this other coding challenge wherein I was given a list of numbers and I need to remove the odd-numbered ones.  I originally plan to solve this by writing a code that goes through each number on the list, check them one by one if they are odd, and remove them if they are.  But then I looked at instructions again and it says that I can solve it either manually or using any of Javascript’s built-in function. So I searched the list of built-in functions and I was able to find one – filter – that exactly does what I am trying to do. </p>
        <p class = "margin-add">It made me happy that I was able to find a more elegant solution as it made my codes much cleaner. It also reminded me of the concept of <strong><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect"  target="_blank">Einstellung</a></strong> which means that prior knowledge can be a barrier to creative problem solving. I am so used in using Excel and this makes my initial response in figuring out a solution to a coding problem is how I’m going to solve it in Excel.</p>

      <h2>Problem solving techniques</h2> 
        <p>The following problem solving techniques are the ones that I routinely used during this sprint’s coding challenge. I can say that I am confident in using them:
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode</li>
            <li>Trying something</li>
            <li>Reading error messages</li>
            <li>Console.logging</li>
            <li>Googling</li>
          </ul>
        </p> 
        <p>However, as the techniques above were mostly sufficient to get me through the challenges, I was not able to practice the techniques below, so I am not as confident in using them:
          <ul>
            <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
            <li class = "margin-add">Improving your process with reflection</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
