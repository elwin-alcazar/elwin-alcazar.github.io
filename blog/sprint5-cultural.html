        <h1>Core Reflection</h1><hr>
        
        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
          <p class = "margin-add">I found mindfulness practice difficult as my mind just is just actively thinking all the time. Doing the coding exercises, I learned that I can still focus and be on a state of flow for prolonged periods of time.  Doing the listening and looping exercise, I found out that it is hard for me to speak for 2 minutes straight talking about my experiences and feelings.</p>

        <hr><h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p class="margin-add">Learning of these three enables one to accept his/her strengths and weaknesses and allows one to determine the learning method most suited for him/her. </p>
        
        <hr><h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p class="margin-add">It surprised me to know that that reflecting is an important aspect of learning.</p>
        
        <hr><h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p class="margin-add">Writing my own thoughts and publishing it in a blog is the most challenging for me.</p>
        
        <hr><h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p class="margin-add">Because in the bootcamp and consequently in actual practice we will be facing difficulties. Thus we need to learn to be resilient and have a framework for effective problem solving.</p>

        <hr><h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          <p class="margin-add">No, the things we learned on the core topics are related to human skills which are just as vital as technical skills if we want to make it in the industry.</p>
