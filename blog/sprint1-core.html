      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>

      <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values</h3>

      <p>I was born and raised in the Philippines and Filipinos are known for having very strong family ties. I am grateful to have parents who are both loving and took care of me really well as I was growing up. Even though I am only child, I grew up close to my cousins and their families. So for me, family is very important. I vow that when my wife and I have children of our own, we will raise them full of love just as our parents did. Also, I will take care of my parents as they grow old.</p>

      <p>Going to a Catholic School in elementary, I was taught to love and be kind to others. Then I went to a pretty liberal university where I was made aware of the social injustices happening all around me. This made me realise that fairness, equality and service to others are also important.  One of my proudest moments in life was when I taught our dorm security staff basic Korean so she can take the Korean language proficiency test needed for employment. She passed and she was able to work in South Korea!</p>

      <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>

      <p>Just last year, as I was about to sign the offer sheet from Dev Academy my former manager offered me a short term job in the company I used to work for (I was made redundant during Covid). I was already unhappy in my line of work since I feel like my skills are being used only for the benefit of these big companies whereas I’d rather put my skills to use in actually helping and improving lives of people. But it pays well and I would also like to provide for me and my wife.</p>
      
      <p>So I decided to take the job and delay my enrolment to Dev Academy for a while.  I figured, maybe I could find another motivation of going to work there, considering that the company has a nice culture and the people are really nice as well. But it made me realise that nope, I really am done and now I wanted to help people for a change. </p>
      
      <p>So when 2021 came and my contract’s about to end, I already said to my manager that I won’t be renewing as I will be doing further study.  And now I was finally able to sign the offer sheet from Dev Academy.</p>
         
      <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>

      <p>Based on VIA Institute on Character’s test, my top five character strengths are:

      <ul>
      <li>Judgment</li>
      <li>Humility</li>
      <li>Kindness</li>
      <li>Fairness</li>
      <li>Curiosity</li>
      </ul>  </p>
      <p>And my top five weaknesses are:
      <ul>
      <li>Leadership</li>
      <li>Bravery</li>
      <li>Creativity</li>
      <li>Zest</li>
      <li>Self-Regulation</li>
    </ul></p>

      <p>Moreover, based on the Big 5 Personalities Assessment, these are my core pattern:

      <ul>
      <li>Empathic Idealist - Uses insight and creativity to help others. Thinks about how the world could be a better and more beautiful place.</li>
      <li>Practical Caretaker - Helps other people in practical, everyday ways. Uses established institutions to maintain stability and security.</li>
      <li>Analytical Thinker - Solves logical problems with rational, complex analysis. Thinks about innovative ways to improve systems.</li>
        <li>Logical Mechanic - Ensures accuracy and efficiency in logical systems. Uses proven methods to accomplish real-world goals.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
      <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development. Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
      <p>I am naturally curious so I enjoy learning new things.  I am analytic and logical which is useful in problem solving. Likewise I will use my judgment in thinking of different ways in solving the problem and then choosing the most sensible one. I am fair and kind so I think I can work well with anyone.</p>  
    
      <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.  </h3>
       <p>Back when I was a compliance administrator for a broker's agency, I usually need some documents from the brokers so that I can make this document that they need to send to their clients as required by law.  Some brokers are notoriously late in sending their files and as per my manager the only thing I could do is to send follow up email. </p> 
       <p>For some brokers, sending follow up email is effective but there are still others who still forget.  I wish I could have sit down with my manager and think of other ways to encourage the brokers to send their files on time instead of just accepting that it is the norm.</p>
