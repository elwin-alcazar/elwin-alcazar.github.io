        <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

        <p class = "margin-add">I want to be a social entrepreneur and empower the underprivileged people from New Zealand and the Philippines. I believe that technology can help bridge these gaps in equality. To realise this goal, I plan to first join a few companies doing Good Tech to learn the ropes and then branch out and start my own.</p>

        <h3 class = "margin-add">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>

        <p>Based on my character strengths of kindness and fairness, I believe I will be a good team player.  I am also analytical and logical which will come handy in problem solving.</p>

        <p class = "margin-add">As for my limitations, I might struggle to think on my feet as I like to do things in a well thought out manner.</p> 

        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>

        <p class = "margin-add">Confidence to speak my mind – I might hesitate to share my opinion because I might feel that I am not an expert hence my words won’t bear any weight.</p>

        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>

        <p class = "margin-add">Since I plan to be a social entrepreneur, I would like my leadership, networking and communication skills to be developed.</p>

        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>

        <p class = "margin-add">I expect the bootcamp team to foster an environment that is nurturing, fun, and collaborative. I also expect them to provide constructive feedback and be available when I need help. I also hope they can provide valuable insights about the industry and how to be successful in it.</p>

        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>

        <p>I expect that for the whole duration of the Bootcamp that it will be my no. 1 priority.</p>

        <p>I also expect myself to prepare questions for the facilitators for our 1 on 1 meetings.</p>

        <p>If I am starting to feel a bit overwhelmed, I will let my facilitator know. Hopefully we can sort things out and be able to determine which tasks I need to prioritise.</p>
      
        <p class = "margin-add">Lastly, I expect myself to enjoy my Bootcamp experience but at the same time use this period to also come up with at least a rough plan on the next steps that I will take.</p>

        
        
        <hr><h1>Foundations learning plan</h1>

        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

        <p class = "margin-add">I want to be a social entrepreneur and empower the underprivileged people from New Zealand and the Philippines. I believe that technology can help bridge these gaps in equality. To realise this goal, I plan to first join a few companies doing Good Tech to learn the ropes and then branch out and start my own.</p>
        
        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
        
        <p> I am naturally curious so I enjoy learning new things. I also like to be well-prepared and this translates to learning through  always ensuring that I have a basic understanding of the current lesson before I move on to a new one. Finally, I am constantly looking for ways to improve, so even in learning, I will try and adapt the most effective methods.</p>
        <p class = "margin-add">Sometimes I am hesitant to ask questions since I feel like the answers are already available via Google and it will be wasting other people’s time if I ask them.</p>
        
        <h3> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
        
        <p class = "margin-add">Since I plan to be a social entrepreneur, I would like my leadership, networking and communication skills to be developed.</p>
        
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
        <h4><ul>
        <li>  An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
        <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</li>
        </ul></h4>
        
        <p>As an early bird, I am most productive in the mornings. Thus I intend to allot my mornings solely to doing Dev Academy work. I will also adopt productivity tools such as the Pomodoro Technique to ensure that I am not just working hard, but working smart as well.  </p>
        
        <p>In a group setting, I am most effective if I am well-prepared. So for every group discussion or meeting, I promise to prepare in advance so that I am able to contribute meaningfully.</p>
        
        <p class = "margin-add">If I am starting to feel a bit overwhelmed, I will let my facilitator know.  Hopefully we can sort things out and be able to determine which tasks I need to prioritise. </p>
        
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p class = "margin-add">I learned that solving problems on your own is an effective method to learn. But since time is of the essence for this programme, I know that I need to reach out and ask for help whenever I am stuck. So I am commiting to solve problems on my own first. But if I still am not able to solve it within 30 - 60 minutes, then I will seek help from my colleagues first and then from the facilitators either through Slack or in person.</p>
         
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
        <p class = "margin-add">I expect the facilitation team to foster an environment that is nurturing and collaborative. I also expect them to provide constructive feedback and be available when I need help. I also hope they can provide valuable insights about the industry and how to be successful in it. </p>
        
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h3>
        <p class = "margin-add">On Tuesday evenings, I usually join the Wellington Waterfront 5k run. On Wednesday evenings, I go to a Korean Language Class. But then again, my top priority is Dev Academy so I can skip these if needed.</p>
