        <h3>What are the principles of neuroplasticity and how can understanding it benefit people?</h3>

          <p>In a published paper, there are 10 principles of neuroplasticity identified:</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Though the paper was focused on applying these principles on damaged brain therapy, we can still adapt and apply them on our daily lives.</p>
          <p class = "margin-add">If we change "brain function" into "learning" or "habit", then we get the secrets on how to learn new things or build new habits!</p>

        <hr><h3>How will you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
          <p>Now that I know that our brains are malleable, I now also know that I can learn anything I want or create a new habit. Consistency and deliberate practice are the keys for success. I will also be patient since learning slows as we age. And it would be
            easier for me to learn if I can relate it to my previous experiences.

        <hr><h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
          <p><ol class="margin-add">
            <li>Learn new things! Learn how to play a musical instrument, or speak a new language.</li>
            <li>Do not cram and get plenty of rest.</li>
            <li>Excercise!</li>
            <li>Practice mindfulness.</li>

        <hr><h3>What are some links to resources that you found particularly useful or engaging?</h3>
          <p>
            <ul class="margin-add">
              <li> Here's a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g" target="_blank">video</a> discussing neuroplasticity.</li>
              <li> This is an <a href="https://constanttherapyhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-Principles-of-Neuroplasticity.pdf" target="_blank">inforgraphic</a> showing the 10 principles of neuroplasticity.</li>
              <li> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn" target="_blank">Coursera</a> has a short course on learning how to learn. <em>Tip: Choose to audit the course if you just want to read the contents and not pay for the completion certificate.</em></li>

        <hr><h3>Growth mindset - discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>

          <p class="margin-add">A person who has a growth mindset believes that human capabilities – both intellectual and emotional, can be cultivated through effort and deliberate practice. This means that we can have ambitious goals, and it is possible to achieve them through hard work and commitment.</p>

        <hr><h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>

          <p class="margin-add">I’ve learned about growth mindset last year during lockdown when I was reading up on positive psychology and flourishing.  This allowed me to have ambitious goals and I know that there is a way for me to achieve them. In fact, if I haven't know about growth mindset, it's possible that I might not have enrolled in this course.</p>

        <hr><h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>

          <p class="margin-add">I will not be discouraged by failure and will not think that I failed but instead I will frame it as a learning experience. I will also not compare my progress against other people but rather check if I’ve improved from yesterday.</p>

        <hr><h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
          <p class="margin-add"><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance" target="_blank">Here</a> is a Ted talk of psychologist Dr. Angela Duckworth about grit being a better predictor for success than IQ. In her self-named website, she defines grit as passion and perseverance over long-term goals.</p>
        
        <hr><h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
          <p class="margin-add">I've now incorporated this mantra in my learning plan: <strong>Grit beats talent every time.</strong></p>
