        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>


        <p class="margin-add">Emotional Intelligence, or EQ, is the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions as well as the emotions of people around you.</p>
        
        
        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
        
        
        <p class="margin-add">EQ is totally different to IQ, While EQ is mostly concerned with how we deal with our emotions, IQ  (or intelligence Quotient) refers to your intellectual ability. IQ tests usually measures one’s ability to use logic and reasoning to solve and answer problems. </p>
        
        <h3>Why is EQ important? </h3>
        
        <p class="margin-add">Recent studies show that EQ is a better determinant of success and happiness than IQ. This means that people with high EQ are generally more successful and happier in life. Now who wouldn’t want that? </p>
        
        <h3>EQ is a skill. </h3>
        
        <p class="margin-add">The good news is: EQ is a skill. And like any skill, anyone can improve one’s EQ skills through training. The video below shows some tips on how we can improve our Emotional Intelligence. </p>
